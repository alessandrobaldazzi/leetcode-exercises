# Programming Exercises

This repo is used as a collection for my solutions to programming exercises found in competitive/interview platforms (like leetcode, hackerrank, ecc...), and to provide a little bit of explanation behind my solutions, the thought process, and other infos if I think they're needed.

The language of my choice is C++, but the reasonings should transfer to whatever language you're using.
